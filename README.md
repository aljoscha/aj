# AJ Coding Agent

AJ is an educational (largely for me!) AI-driven agent for software
engineering. Initially inspired by and based on [How to Build an
Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent).

Built on the premise that better models just need better tools. We therefore
have a minimal agent loop and focus on providing the right set of builtin
tools, with otherwise minimal scaffolding around it.
