# Module audit progress

Tracking file for the audit specified in `docs/audit/audit-plan.md`.
This is the file to point a session at:

> follow `@docs/audit/audit-progress.md` and do the next step

## How to do the next step

1. Read `docs/audit/audit-plan.md` for the rubric, severity taxonomy, and
   report template. (You only need to internalize it once per session.)
2. In the tables below, find the first step with status `TODO` and start it.
3. Record the commit under audit: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
4. **Spawn one read-only sub-agent** for the step. Its task must:
   - tell it to read `docs/audit/audit-plan.md` for the rubric and the
     `_TEMPLATE.md` format;
   - list the exact files in the step's scope (see the plan), including
     their tests;
   - have it **write** its report to `docs/audit/findings/<unit>.md` from
     the template, and **return** a short summary plus severity counts;
   - remind it the audit is **read-only**: no edits to source or tests.
5. Read the written findings file; sanity-check that it's specific,
   classified, and actionable.
6. Update this file: set the step's status to `Done`, fill in the
   severity counts, the findings link, the audited commit, and the date.
   Add anything reusable to "Cross-cutting themes".
7. Commit: `docs(audit): <unit> findings`.
8. Stop after one step (incremental mode), unless explicitly driving
   multiple steps in one session.

The final step **X1** is done by the main agent directly (no sub-agent):
it reads every findings report and synthesizes a top-level summary.

## Cross-cutting themes

Recurring observations collected as steps complete; consumed by X1.
- **Error-type consistency at SDK boundaries** (S1): non-streaming
  `messages()` returns `anyhow::Error` while the streaming path returns
  structured `ClientError`. Check both SDKs standardize on a structured
  error (status + retry-after) and avoid `anyhow` in lib crates.
- **Dead/unused public surface on "thin" clients** (S1): SDKs expose more
  than `aj-models` consumes (orphaned conversions, setters,
  never-constructed error variants). Set one surface policy and apply it.
- **`thiserror` vs. hand-written `Display`** (S1): `ApiError` hand-rolls
  `Display` while deriving `Error`; pick one convention across crates.
- **Where wire-correctness is asserted** (S1, S2): SDKs lean on
  `aj-models/tests/roundtrip/` rather than testing their own request/error
  mapping. Decide where the HTTP boundary is covered. Confirmed for both.
- **Within-crate duplication of error/SSE mapping** (S2): openai-sdk's two
  streaming methods duplicate non-2xx + `Retry-After` + SSE-parse logic
  verbatim. Check whether aj-models adapters (M3/M4) repeat this.
- **Unused declared dependency** (S2, M1): `async-stream` declared but
  unused in openai-sdk and aj-models. Sweep all crates for unused deps.
- **Duplicated type across the aj-models/aj-agent boundary** (M1):
  `tools::Tool` duplicates `types::ToolDefinition`; `aj-agent` round-trips
  `ErasedToolDefinition → Tool → ToolDefinition`. Revisit in AG2.
- **`anyhow` reaches into lib crates** (S1, S2, M1): confirmed again in
  `aj-models/src/refresh.rs`. Track all lib-crate `anyhow` use.
- **Streaming hot-path cost** (M2): partial-JSON tool-arg parsing is
  O(n²) (each delta reparses the cumulative buffer) plus per-event deep
  clones. Watch the adapters (M3/M4) for similar.
- **Non-determinism from wall-clock in lib code** (M2): `transform.rs`
  stamps synthetic orphan tool-results with `Utc::now()`. Sweep for
  `Utc::now()`/`Instant::now()` in pure transform/persistence paths.
- **Stream end without terminal event → false success** (M3, M4):
  **CONFIRMED across all four providers** (Anthropic, OpenAI completions,
  Responses, Codex). A stream closing without a terminal frame finalizes
  as `Done/Stop`, so a truncated turn looks complete and is never retried.
  This is the single most impactful cross-cutting finding so far.
- **Duplicated error mapping across endpoints** (S2, M4): `classify_client_error`
  duplicated byte-for-byte across OpenAI completions/responses and a third
  time in Codex. SSE framing is correctly delegated to the SDKs (refuted).
- **Divergent terminal-error handling between sibling providers** (M4):
  Codex turns terminal `response.failed`/`error` into a hard `Err`
  (dropping partial content+usage) while Responses preserves the partial.
- **Secrets: token body leaks into error strings** (M5): on a 2xx OAuth
  token response that fails to deserialize, the raw body (live access/
  refresh tokens) is folded into `OAuthError::Parse` → logs/terminal.
  Sweep all `format!`s over HTTP bodies on auth paths.
- **Sibling OAuth duplication** (M5): anthropic/openai OAuth modules are
  ~80% byte-identical (callback server, parsing, mock harness) with no
  shared seam — widest duplication locus so far. Pairs with M4 error-map
  duplication.
- **Non-atomic user-file writes** (C1, SE1, TO2): three axes/loci. C1:
  `Config::save` truncates in place. SE1: append-only log never fsyncs.
  TO2: `write_file`/`edit_file`/`edit_file_multi` all `fs::write`
  truncate-in-place — highest-frequency locus, and `edit_file_multi`
  advertises an "atomic" contract its write doesn't honor. Sweep all
  user-file writers for write-temp+rename and/or fsync.
- **Tool descriptions diverge from behavior** (TO2): the `agent` tool says
  "single turn" but runs the full uncapped agent loop; edit tools omit
  their exact-substring/non-overlapping-count contract. The model-facing
  schema is a contract — verify all tool descriptions match behavior.
- **Dead surface on central abstractions** (T1, sibling of AG1/M-surface
  themes): six `Terminal` trait methods have no production caller (the
  renderer inlines escape bytes), exercised only by test doubles. Central
  portability seam carries dead surface. Pairs with the over-broad/
  test-only `pub` theme.
- **Workspace dependency pinning drift** (T1): `aj-tui` pins direct
  versions (crossterm, unicode-*) instead of `[workspace.dependencies]`.
  Sweep manifests in X1 (alongside the AG1 edition drift).
- **POSITIVE pattern — render hot path** (T1): the tui renderer reuses one
  frame buffer, skips byte-identical rows, and restores the terminal on
  panic (atomics + panic hook + Drop). Hold this up as the model for the
  perf/teardown themes.
- **Internal god-objects wanting decomposition** (T1, T3): `Tui` (59 public
  methods, fuses diff/overlay/focus) and `Editor` (3868 lines, ~40 fields,
  embeds the whole autocomplete subsystem). Public surfaces are
  disciplined; the sprawl is internal. Candidates for extraction.
- **Keybinding vocabulary mismatch** (T3): `keybindings` formats
  `meta`/`cmd`/`super` but `keys::parse_key_id` rejects `meta`/`cmd`, so a
  user-configured `cmd+k` formats fine but never fires. Verify against the
  `aj` keybindings config (A1).
- **Unbounded markdown parser recursion on model output** (T4): nested
  `**`/`>`/`[[...]]` can overflow the stack and abort the process — no
  depth cap, no test, and the input is untrusted model text rendered every
  turn. Highest crash-risk finding in the TUI; treat as a real hazard.
- **Sibling-component drift** (T1, T4): `SelectList` vs `SettingsList` are
  drifted re-implementations of one scroll/filter/render widget (cf. T1's
  overlay-routing duplicated 4x). The widest UI-layer duplication.
- **Tab-width constant duplicated** (T2, T4): "tab = 3 spaces" is spelled
  as magic literals across `ansi.rs`, `text.rs`, `markdown.rs`. Hoist one
  shared constant.
- **Wall-clock coupling in timing tests** (M2/SE1 wall-clock theme, T5):
  `aj-tui` `terminal.rs`/`loader.rs` progress tests use real
  `thread::sleep` keyed to a 1000ms interval and assert emission counts —
  CI-flaky and ~5s wall-clock, against the suite's own paused-clock tier.
  Sweep all crates for sleep-based timing assertions.
- **POSITIVE pattern — test boundary harness** (T5): the `aj-tui` suite is
  the workspace high-water mark — a real VT100 virtual terminal asserts on
  rendered viewport (not internals), with strong edge/regression coverage.
  Hold up as the model for the "happy-path-only" gaps seen elsewhere
  (M3/M4 roundtrips, C1, auth).
- **Concurrency / single-writer guard** (SE1, NEW): two `aj continue <id>`
  processes interleave JSONL lines and mint colliding entry ids,
  corrupting the parent chain. No file lock. Check the binary (A2/A3)
  for whether it ever opens the same thread twice.
- **Replay drops persisted timestamps** (SE1): the log records per-entry
  `Utc::now()` but projection/replay discards it, so resumed turns lose
  their original timeline. Pairs with the wall-clock theme.
- **Test harness shipped in production public API** (M5, TO1): aj-models
  `scripted` (with a `panic!` arm) and aj-tools `testing.rs`
  (`DummyToolContext`) are ungated `pub mod`s. Decide a uniform policy
  (`#[cfg(test)]`, a `testing` feature, or a separate dev crate).
- **Duplicated disabled-tools filter** (TO1): the disabled-tools filter is
  copy-pasted across three binary call sites though `aj-tools` owns the
  catalog. Confirm in A1/A2 and consider a single seam in `aj-tools`.
- **Two truncation impls with different safety contracts** (M2, TO1, T2):
  now THREE. `aj-models::transform::truncate` (byte, ASCII-assuming),
  `aj-tools::truncate` (line-oriented, UTF-8-safe), and `aj-tui` text
  (display-width-authoritative). They solve different problems but the
  shared name misleads; reconcile naming/scoping in X1.
- **Real-env/wall-clock coupling without an injection seam** (M2, M5, C1):
  `AgentEnv::new()` reads cwd/HOME/FS/`Utc::now()` directly; tests can't
  isolate it. Recurs with the wall-clock theme; a context/env seam would
  help testability across the binary too.
- **Dependency graph drift vs. CLAUDE.md** (AG1, CRITICAL): `aj-agent`
  depends on `aj-conf` (`AgentEnv`, `ConfigThinkingLevel`), but the stated
  graph says the runtime depends only on `aj-models`. X1 must verify every
  edge against the doc and decide: move the shared config types down, or
  update the graph.
- **Runtime trusts provider terminal blindly** (AG1): the agent treats a
  provider `Done` as a complete turn with no re-classification, so the
  four-provider truncation bug lands on the transcript. Pairs with the
  truncation theme above; the fix likely needs a runtime-side guard.
- **Dead declared surface in the event taxonomy** (AG1): `TurnEnd`,
  `QueueUpdate`, `ToolExecutionUpdate` are never emitted; `AgentEnd.messages`
  always empty despite its doc. Sibling of the test-only-`pub` theme.
- **Manifest/edition drift** (AG1): `aj-agent` pins `edition = "2021"`
  against a 2024 workspace. Sweep all crate manifests in X1.
- **`anyhow` reaches the public tool trait** (AG2): `Tool::execute` and
  `spawn_agent` return `anyhow::Result`, so every downstream tool inherits
  the dependency and failures are only string-renderable. Broadest
  anyhow-in-lib locus; pairs with the M1/M5 error-type theme.
- **Half-wired `emit_update` feature across three layers** (AG1, AG2):
  `ToolContext::emit_update` is documented but the runtime impl is a
  permanent no-op, yet `bash` self-throttles and the TUI carries debounce
  logic for it. This is the source of AG1's dead `ToolExecutionUpdate`
  event. Decide: finish wiring or remove all three layers.
- **Tool/ToolDefinition duplication is the runtime's fault, not the
  contract's** (AG2): the tool contract cleanly yields `ErasedToolDefinition`
  (1:1 with wire `UnifiedToolDefinition`); the redundant `tools::Tool` hop
  is introduced in `aj-agent/src/lib.rs:167` and is removable without
  touching the contract.
- **Happy-path-only roundtrip coverage** (M3, M4): confirmed across all
  provider roundtrip suites; the truncation Major lives in an untested path.
- **Test-only `pub` items widen the surface** (M3, M4): widest locus is
  M4 (10 items). Recurs with M1/M2 surface findings.

Note: all S1 themes were confirmed in S2 (error split doubled, broader
dead surface, identical `ApiError` Display pattern).
